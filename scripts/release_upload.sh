# A tag's GitHub release with these files attached. The Linux AppImage and Windows builder workflows both call it: the
# first to get there makes the release (from the tag, with GitHub's generated notes), the other adds its files to it, so
# the two never race to make two releases. When the Release workflow has made it already (semantic-release, with its
# notes), the files are only added. A version with a prerelease part (v0.2.0-rc.1) is a prerelease and never "latest".
# A file already on the release is replaced, so a run again on the same tag updates it. Needs gh, with GH_TOKEN
# (contents: write) and GH_REPO set. No game data is involved: a file whose name looks like the game's or a dump's, or
# like NVIDIA's runtime files, is refused.
