# Hookshot (oot-recomp)

**Hookshot** is the port's name (as Skybound is TOTKPort's and BlueShell is mkw-recomp's); the maintainer's repository
folder stays `oot-recomp`. The game builds as `hookshot.exe` + `hookshot_vk.dll` (`hookshot` + `hookshot_vk.so` on Linux).

A static recompilation of the Switch 2 *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time* remake to native x86-64 Windows and Linux:
the game's code lifted to C (NotRexed's a64-kit, Rexcomp's AArch64 kit), the Horizon OS and NVN2 implemented
natively, the GPU work replayed on Vulkan. It is a fork of mkw-recomp (`..\mkw-recomp`, Mario Kart World), whose
paths it keeps so MKW's fixes apply here.

**No game files are in this repository.** The dump is read where it lies (`work/dump.txt`); everything made from it
(modules, image, lifted C, builds, runs) goes to `work/`, which git ignores.

Status: the game plays; the README's [status table](../readme.md#project-status) says how far. The design, its stages and
the lessons carried over from MKW: [design.md](design.md).

## Use

Requirements: Python 3 with `lz4`, `numpy`, `capstone`, `unicorn` (2.1), `zstandard`; a compiler: on Windows llvm-mingw
(`HOOKSHOT_MINGW`, or an `llvm-mingw` folder in the clone), else emsdk's clang at `C:\emsdk` (or `EMSDK`) with Visual
Studio's C++ tools; on Linux clang and lld. For the Vulkan back end, a CPM package cache with the Vulkan and SPIR-V
headers, VMA and FFmpeg: `RX_CPM`, else `cpm` in the clone, else the old caches in mkw-recomp's `work/eg` or
`..\Eglantine\.cache\cpm`. [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup) says where each comes from.

Run everything with `python -I` from this folder.

| Command | What |
|---|---|
| `python -I nx2/nup.py <file.nup> --extract work/dump` | the `.nup` dump package to `work/dump/exefs` + `romfs` (newest title; ZBIC NSOs made plain by `nx2/unpack.py`) |
| `python -I nx2/dump.py --dump <folder with exefs/ and romfs/> --set` | what the dump is (Switch 1 or 2, ids, modules, SDK, NVN); `--set` records it in `work/dump.txt` |
| `python -I nx2/lift.py [--write]` | image + discovery + coverage (`work/image/coverage.txt`); `--write` emits the C to `work/gen` |
| `python -I nx2/census.py --nx2` | instruction census per module, after the Switch 2 forms |
| `python -I nx2/test_insn.py [--per 6 --states 12]` | every instruction form the game uses, Unicorn vs lifted C |
| `python -I nx2/test_leaf.py [--count 3000 --states 4] [--calls]` | random whole functions (or call trees), Unicorn vs recompiled native code on the real image |
| `python -I nx2/lift.py --standalone --write` then `python -I nx2/build.py --standalone --jobs 4` | the standalone game: `work/sa/build/hookshot.exe` + `hookshot_vk.dll` |
| `powershell -File scripts/run-vk.ps1 [-Window] [-Seconds 120] [-Name x]` | a muted test run on Vulkan, with screenshots in `work/runs/<name>/shots` |
| `python -I scripts/prof.py <stacks file>` | a profile sampled with `HOS_PROFILE=<seconds>` + `HOS_SAMPLE=<thread>` + `HOS_SAMPLE_FILE=<stacks file>` (the sampler runs only with `HOS_PROFILE` set), named from the linker maps |

The dump can also come from `OOT_DUMP` (its folder) or `OOT_EXEFS`; `OOT_WORK` moves the work folder.

The built game's own arguments (`image.bin`, `--romfs`, `--user`, `--trace`, `--prepare-shaders`) are in the README's
[Running the game from the command line](../readme.md#running-the-game-from-the-command-line).

Scripted test input (`HOS_INPUT_SCRIPT` and `HOS_INPUT_LIVE`) is applied before the window-focus check. A log saying
the game window is not in front does not mean those presses were discarded. `HOS_HEADLESS` and
`HOS_WINDOW_NOACTIVATE` change window creation, not this input routing. The game must still reach a state that reads
and responds to the supplied controller input.

Physical keyboard and mouse input stays with the foreground window. Physical controllers can also play in the
background when the existing "Controller in background" option or `HOS_INPUT_BACKGROUND=1` enables them;
`HOS_INPUT_BACKGROUND=0` overrides that option. `HOS_INPUT_EXCLUSIVE=1` controls merging the player's devices while
the script's existing exclusive interval is active; it is not a focus override.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `docs/design.md` | why mkw-recomp's pipeline, the architecture, MKW's lessons as rules, stages, testing |
| `nx2/` | the lift pipeline and its tests (mkw-recomp's, made game-neutral; `kit.py` has the paths), and `make_game.py`, which the builders run |
| `host/` | the standalone Horizon runtime (TOTKPort's `hos/` as adapted by mkw-recomp), with the native NVN2 layer `nvn_native.c`; `host/posix` has the Win32 calls on Linux |
| `gpu/vk/` | the Vulkan back end (`hookshot_vk.dll`, `hookshot_vk.so`), with Eden's shader recompiler and sirit |
| `gpu/render/`, `gpu/third_party/` | the WebGPU renderer the Windows exe falls back to when it was built with wgpu-native, its op stream (`rx_nvn.h`), suyu's decoders |
| `builder/` | Hookshot Builder: the Windows app (.NET 8 WPF), its setup and MSI, and the Linux builder and launcher scripts |
| `scripts/` | test runs, the profile and log readers, the save copier (`oot_saves.py`), release tooling, `scripts/linux` (dependencies, AppImage) |
| `tests/` | the game-free checks, all run by `tests/run_all.py` |
| `third_party/` | a64-kit (Hookshot's few changes marked `(hookshot)`), libopus, zbic (Atmosphere's zstd with ZBIC, for unpacking only), SDL2's licence, stb_truetype |
