# Upscaling and frame generation

This is a plan, not a description of what the renderer does today. It names the integration point,
the input contract, the licensing rules each vendor runtime imposes, and the order the work can land
in. Nothing here is implemented yet; each section below is one pull request.

## What exists today

| | Where | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `resolution` | `gpu/vk/vk_menu.h`, `nx2/oot_patches.py` | The 3D scale: Auto (the game's dynamic resolution), or 100/75/67/50% of full |
| `upscale` | `gpu/vk/vk_menu.h`, `framegen_scale` | A spatial filter on the finished window image: off, Catmull-Rom, Lanczos |
| Frame generation | `gpu/vk/vk_framegen.cpp` | Image-space interpolation: quarter-size luma, 16x16 block matching within +-32 px, a 3x3 median, then a forward/backward blend per made frame |
| The game's own upscaler | `taau_stand_in`, `gpu/vk/vk_draw.cpp` | OoT evaluates a neural TAAU network (program `fd029a317a9a4b94`). Where the device has no hardware f16 matrix multiply (or with `RX_VK_NO_F16`), a compute stand-in replaces it, because the translated network loses the blue channel and casts the scene yellow; elsewhere the network itself runs. `RX_VK_TAAU_KEYS` overrides either way |
| The per-network log | `gpu/vk/vk_draw.cpp`, `gpu/vk/upscale_contract.h` | Once per network key: its dispatch size, its sampled textures, what each one is in the input contract below, and whether a temporal upscaler could stand in |

Two consequences follow from that table, and they decide the whole design.

**The game already upscales temporally.** It renders the 3D at a dynamic internal resolution and
resolves it with its own network. A vendor upscaler does not need a new low-resolution path invented
for it; it needs to take that network's place. Note that on a card with hardware f16 matrix multiply
the network runs as itself, so a replacement cannot be built inside the stand-in alone: the dispatch
has to be recognized whether or not the stand-in is the thing currently handling it.

**The finished window image is the wrong place.** `upscale` and the frame interpolator both work on
the composited frame, after the HUD. A temporal upscaler there has no depth, no motion and a HUD
baked into its history. That is why the existing interpolator block-matches: it has nothing better to
work from.

## The integration point

`taau_stand_in()` in `gpu/vk/vk_draw.cpp` already recognizes the network's dispatch by program key
and substitutes its own resolve. A vendor upscaler replaces the same dispatch, under the same
recognition, and falls back to the existing stand-in whenever it cannot run. That keeps one code path
for "the network did not run as itself" instead of two.

The replay rules in [design notes, section 4](design.md#4-the-lessons-from-mkw-as-rules-here) apply
unchanged. In particular the inputs are read from the submitted dispatch's own descriptors during
ordered replay, never from live guest memory.

## The input contract

A temporal upscaler needs the network's own inputs, and it must only run when they are all present and
of the expected shape:

- low-resolution color, HDR, matching the output's format
- motion, two channels, normalized toward the previous frame, in render pixels
- depth, reversed, at the render extent
- a fresh jitter sample for this frame, in render pixels

and it must reset its history on a resolution change, on first use, and after a gap longer than about
250 ms (a pause, a menu, a load). A camera cut is a separate reset that this game does not hand us
directly.

`gpu/vk/upscale_contract.h` decides which sampled binding is which, and `gpu/vk/upscale_format.h`
decides what each Vulkan format counts as. Both are driven by `tests/upscale_contract_test.cpp`
without a game, a GPU or a dispatch. Motion and depth fix the render extent, because they are the two
a network cannot sample at another size; the colour at that extent is the input. A colour at a larger
extent is reported as full-size and nothing more: the renderer records what a dispatch's descriptors
sample *or store* in one list, so the history and the output cannot be told apart there, and the seam
in row 2 is where that is resolved.

Where any of that does not hold, the native dispatch or the stand-in stays. An upscaler that runs on
inputs it has guessed produces ghosting that looks like a renderer bug and is reported as one.

> The same contract, derived for a different Switch 2 title in a sibling GPL-3.0 project, is written up
> in Eglantine's `docs/native-dlss-replacement.md`. The formats there (B10G11R11 color, R16G16 motion,
> D32 depth) are that game's, not necessarily this one's: the shapes have to be read off OoT's own
> dispatch before anything is wired to them.

## The seam

`gpu/vk/upscale_seam.h` is where a backend is chosen. The renderer resolves a recognized dispatch once into an
`upscale::Request` — what the sampled bindings provide, the image the dispatch writes, and which binding the renderer
is going to hand over as colour — and `choose()` says which backend takes it. A backend never re-derives the dispatch
for itself.

`temporal_possible()` is the gate a temporal backend has to pass, and every clause in it is a wrong picture rather
than a missing feature: the inputs must be complete, the output must be resolved, writable and no smaller than the
render extent, and the colour the renderer hands over must be the colour the contract identified.

That last clause does not hold yet, and the seam says so in its log rather than assuming it away. The renderer passes
`dw.imgs[0]`, the first texture descriptor; the contract indexes the textures the descriptor build resolved
(`draw_sampled`). Those are two different lists — the first carries every texture descriptor, the second only the
ones it resolved — so binding 0 of one is not binding 0 of the other. Establishing which descriptor is the
contract's colour is the first job of the backend that needs it. Until then `temporal_possible()` refuses, which is
the point: it cannot be passed by accident.

The stand-in needs none of this. It is a spatial resolve, and it runs wherever `RX_VK_TAAU_KEYS` asks for it exactly
as it did before the seam existed, including where the contract is not met. That property is what makes introducing
the seam a no-op, and `tests/upscale_seam_test.cpp` pins it.

## Order of work

Each row is one pull request, and each one is useful on its own.

| # | Change | Why it is first |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Name each network binding's role in the existing per-network log, and say whether the inputs are complete | Nothing can be built until the contract above is read off the real dispatch rather than assumed, and the log that reports a network's textures was already there |
| 2 | A vendor-neutral seam at `taau_stand_in`, with the stand-in as its only backend | No behaviour change, and it is the review that decides the shape |
| 3 | FSR 3.1 temporal upscaling as the first backend | MIT sources, no external runtime, works on every vendor, so it is the backend that can be the default |
| 4 | DLSS Super Resolution: Streamline on Windows, NGX on Linux | Needs a user-supplied runtime, so it comes after a working fallback exists |
| 5 | Presets, quality modes and DLAA in the Insert menu and `hookshot_options.ini` | Settings for backends that exist, rather than settings-first |
| 6 | Frame generation from real motion and depth | Replaces the block matcher's guess where the inputs are available |

## What each vendor runtime allows

**FSR.** AMD's FidelityFX sources are MIT. They can be vendored under `third_party/` with a
`PROVENANCE.md`, unmodified, and need no runtime from the user. FSR 4's newer models arrive through
AMD's own runtime library on Windows; the SDK path works everywhere.

**DLSS.** The Streamline headers are MIT and can be vendored the same way. **The runtime libraries are
not**, must not be committed, and must not be bundled in a release. The user supplies them, or the
build fetches them only after the user has accepted NVIDIA's license. Streamline has no Linux build,
so Linux uses NGX directly — `libnvidia-ngx.so` ships with the NVIDIA driver, and the model library
sits beside the binary. The same two backends therefore need two loaders behind one interface.

Neither backend may be a build requirement: a tree with no SDK present builds, and a machine with no
runtime present runs, with the stand-in.

## Ray Reconstruction

Ray Reconstruction (DLSS's denoising upscaler) is **not** on the list above, and should not be
promised for this game. It replaces a ray-traced renderer's denoiser, and it needs guide buffers —
albedo, normals, roughness, specular hit distance — that only a ray-traced or G-buffer pipeline
produces. OoT's Switch 2 build is rasterized, and nothing in the replayed command stream identifies
such targets: a search of `gpu/` finds no normal, albedo or roughness target anywhere. Turning it on
with color, motion and depth alone would give a different upscaling network, not denoising, and would
be a worse-documented version of row 4.

If the intent is "the newest DLSS quality", that is the transformer presets in row 5, on top of
Super Resolution in row 4.

## Frame generation, honestly

The existing interpolator shows made frames about one frame behind the game, and skips interpolation
across hitches over 100 ms. Real motion and depth improve what it makes, but they do not change
either property. DLSS frame generation is a Streamline feature and so would be Windows-only; FSR's
frame interpolation is available on both. Neither removes the latency a frame-interpolating renderer
has by construction, and #755 should be read before any of it is wired to the Insert menu.
